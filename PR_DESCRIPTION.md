## 🚀 Getting Started

After merging this PR, developers can:

1. **Setup the environment**:

   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```

2. **Create a new agent**:

   ```bash
   npm run generate:agent
   ```

3. **Start development**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Validate agents**:
   ```bash
   npm run validate:all-agents
   ```

## 🔧 Requirements Addressed

This implementation addresses the following requirements from the spec:

- **6.1**: Agent development documentation and tooling
- **6.3**: Agent compliance and validation tools
- **6.4**: Interactive agent creation system
- **6.5**: Automated testing utilities
- **8.1**: Development environment setup
- **8.2**: Agent template system
- **8.3**: Code quality enforcement
- **8.5**: Mock data generation for testing

## 🛠️ Technical Fixes Applied

### TypeScript Strict Mode Compliance

- **Logger Interface Enhancement**: Extended `logSignal` function to accept additional properties like `confidence`, `poolAddress`, `amount`, etc., resolving type conflicts in existing agents
- **Mock Data Generator**: Fixed `randomChoice` method with proper TypeScript method overloading to handle both single item and array returns
- **Command Line Parsing**: Added null safety checks for all CLI argument parsing to prevent undefined assignments
- **Array Access Safety**: Added non-null assertions for array access where bounds are guaranteed
- **Missing Scripts**: Created all referenced utility scripts (`export-agent-memory.ts`, `agent-list.ts`, `stress-test.ts`, `simulate-cluster.ts`)

### Code Quality Improvements

- **Strict TypeScript Configuration**: Enabled `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` and other strict compiler options
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Added proper error handling and validation throughout all scripts
- **Type Safety**: Ensured all functions have proper return types and parameter validation

## 🎉 Benefits

- **Faster Development**: Interactive tools reduce agent creation time
- **Higher Quality**: Comprehensive validation ensures agent compliance
- **Better Testing**: Mock data generators enable thorough testing
- **Consistent Code**: Automated formatting and linting
- **Reliable CI/CD**: Automated quality checks and testing
- **Developer Experience**: Hot reloading and real-time feedback

## 🧪 Testing

All new functionality has been tested with:

- Unit tests for core utilities
- Integration tests for agent validation
- Mock data generation for various scenarios
- CI pipeline validation

## 📝 Breaking Changes

None. This PR is purely additive and enhances the existing development workflow without breaking existing functionality.

**Note**: The enhanced logger interface is backward compatible - existing agents will continue to work, but can now optionally include additional signal properties for richer logging.

## 🔄 Migration Guide

No migration needed. Existing agents will continue to work unchanged. Developers can opt-in to the new tooling as needed.
